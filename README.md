This is a game with vanilla javascript and jquery code made by me in the bootcamp from Angela Yu. 

All HTML, css, sounds, etc were provided by Brewery Lab team. There were some minimal changes to those files to achieve some animations, like turning the background color to red when the user chooses wrong.
